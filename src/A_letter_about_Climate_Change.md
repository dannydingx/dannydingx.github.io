# Is Climate Change Really an Issue?

This Year at January, I went on a flight from US to China, it was in the middle of the flight and the whole plane is silent and dim, many passengers were sleeping. I was not slept, I hate sleeping on airplanes, I didn't sleep even in that 13-hours long international flight. I felt a little too boring at that time, so I slightly pull the blind plate of the airplane's window up, expected to see the starlight at night, however, its at the daytime. At a moment, I saw a whole sheet of white underneath me, its the Alaska tundra; without any sign of human activities, that land seems to be mysteriously tranquil. Then, I saw some 'rips' amid that expansive 'white', my intuition told me that its not part of the dreamlike scene of the snow kingdom. Indeed, I have read about what is happening under the arctic tundra, global warming is gradually melting ices and glaciers, as the tundra releasing more greenhouse gases like methane to the atmosphere and aggravated the global warming. When I watched at the arctic from the plane at a long sight, I saw the huge amount of flammable ice underneath it, I saw a story about a species and a planet over the history, a story about us. I took a picture of that scene, and pull down the blind. 'We could conquer it', I thought.

According to the NASA's website of global climate change (Ref 3):

> Greenland lost an average of **286** billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about **127** billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has **tripled** in the last decade.
>
> The globe sea level is also continue to growth at a rate of **3.3** millimeters per year.
>
> The extreme weather condition in ocean have also cause extreme climate events, like increase number of intense rainfall events. Change in worldwide-climate pattern.
>
> The Ocean also was acidified by many man-produced emissions like many greenhouse gases. Nasa’s data shown that the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about **30** since the Industrial  Revolution. This increase could destroy the biome system of coral and algae in the ocean that many of living organisms relied on. 
>
> The planet's average surface temperature has raised by **0.9** Celsius since the late 19th century, while scientist predicted a global temperature increase of **1.5** will be a crucial upper limit - we could not control the situation when its change is beyond that level. (Ref 1)

All these data and prediction are suggesting us an undoubtable truth: The Climate of Earth **is** getting **abnormal** in our age. As a member of human society, I want to share my view of this issue, probably we could change something.

### 1. The boy who cried wolf?

According to a study designed to research the climate change in the Americans mind, only **15%** of Americans understand that most climate scientists (more than **90%**) have concluded that human-cause global warming in happening. The study also asked subjects how important they felt the global warming could been related to their personally, the result is shown below (Ref 2):

| Answer                     | Percentage of Sample |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Extremely | 10%       |
| Very | 18%      |
| Somewhat | 35%     |
| Not too | 22% |
| Not at all | 15% |

*Chart2 American's mind to Global Warming (Ref 2)*

Indeed, this data is fairly unexpected because it didn't shown enough evidence that most people felt worried about global warming, and there was an information asymmetry between common citizens and the climate scientists, of course, **citizens have underestimate the effect of global warming**. In recent years, more and more political groups stand at the opposite side of global warming, conspiracy theories was created about scientist's conclusion of climate change. Some state that it was a total lie used for political benefits for some developing countries, even the current president also support some of these views. Even the credit of scientists was damaged by these 'critical' thinking, so, what's wrong?

I think this underestimation is a result of citizens didn't have enough direct intuitionally sense of what kind of disasters we are facing, and that's not a strange thing, that's not citizen's fault. Look how most of us lived,  we enjoyed the convenience of modern society, we have internet and electronics, we could order food easily, travelled through our own automobiles, trains, planes to anywhere over the world. When we talked about global warming and climate change, what will we think about, probably no more than a task on the textbook, a topic of essay, a issue that we could talked about after the dinner, even when we thought about it, we mostly subconsciously linked it to the developing and poorer countries and regions. But, have we actually thought, even once, that this is a issue about our future, about the future of a great culture that have been existing over more than 3 million years? Maybe not, because lived in such a peaceful and glorious world, we hardly think of anything destructive, anything that might tear all of them into pieces. Even when I first did this assignment, I just considered it as a 'annoying' final project in Biology class. Because the simultaneous effect of global warming is too unobvious for us to consider, it could only been observe from the long term view, too much people, data was not such persuasive if nothing really happened to them, to them, global warming is like the boy who cried wolf.

### 2. Climate Change is not a 'Political Hoax'!	

So, what is the real issue? I think the data I gave above is enough persuasive (*Chart1 and above*). Nevertheless, someone may argue that they were caused by natural effect but not human activities. It's true that globe temperature might been altered naturally, there is one historical event of abnormal climate, called Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum -**PETM**. PETM was an increase in global temperature 5-8 Celsius at about 56 million years ago, about to be the age that the dinosaurs became extinct. In this natural event, the density of CO2 in the atmosphere suddenly increased probably due to volcanos'  activities, and that event lead to ocean acidification, also disasters of the ecosystem. However, when scientists start to do research using  remaining deep sedimentary record under the ocean, about PETM, what they found is that the rate of carbon emitting though human now is actually much more (at least **10 times**) larger than that rate of PETM. And the group said the future outcome of climate change we did now is still 'unclear'.(Ref 4)

![Current and PETM rates of atmospheric carbonization over time (wunderground.com)](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2016/03/Current-vs-PETM-270x150.png) 

*Graph2 The rate of Carbon Emission by human, Compare with PETM (Ref 4)* 

Thus, under common conditions, its not rational to explained this abnormalities of global temperature change as the 'Natural Change'.

Moreover, someone may argue that the Carbon Dioxide we produced is much less than that produced by the bacteria. That fact was true, but we should understand the the earth ecosystem is a dynamic balanced system, although it could adjust itself, it adjust in a very long time under a big time scale. In the history of the earth, the temperature change was control by the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and that was controlled by the flow of carbon element, the **Carbon Cycle**. In this cycle, plants processed the photosynthesize, transformed CO2 into organic carbon, and that organic carbon passed through the food chain, been ate by animals and dissolved into CO2, this is a Carbon Cycle for biosphere. Some of, for some reasons, insoluble organic carbon therefore will subside into the ocean and underground, became fossil fuel or limestone, and eventually these carbon will transformed to CO2 in atmosphere when volcano erupted.(Ref 5)

*Graph3 Carbon Cycle (Ref5)*

However, the Carbon Cycle of rocks happened in a larger time scale, probably million years for one loop. Now, this fact was changed when human began to utilize the fossil fuel underground and quickly released the carbon inside them into the atmosphere as the form of greenhouses. Yes, first time in the earth's history, the speed of carbon cycle for rocks dramatically increased. The earth's carbon cycle's self adjustment happened only in a long time scale, the sudden increase in Carbon by industrial is way beyond the nature's self-adjust potency.  And we should knew that a 'Cycle' in ecosystem is fragile, a leak or surplus in a single part of the chain could destroy the whole thing, the failure of Biosphere 2 is one example.

If we check the whole earth's history, we should know that both the temperature and the level of carbohydrates in atmosphere is not at their highest point now. However, it didn't give us a reason to ignore the global warming effect, because we are the breaker of the earth's long-scale temperature changing pattern, and this happened in just 300 years.

*Graph4 Change in CO2 density in atmosphere (Ref3)*

Let's see a more detailed data, this is graphs indicate historical geographic data about the earth in 800 000 years before present time. In this graph, we saw a strong association of CO2, Sea level, Climate Forcing, and Temperature, they followed a similar pattern. That pattern seems to be periodic, that should be the natural climate change of earth. The industrial age happened in the very right of the graph, by the NASA's research, the current CO2 level is already **410 ppm**, larger than historical level in 800,000 years; the methane level is at about **1850** ppm, nearly three times the historical average level. (Ref 6)

*Graph5 Historical Geographic Data (Ref6)*

To conclude, although scientists were still debating on the exact consequence of global warming caused by human, its objectively a fact that Human did broke the nature climate pattern.

### 3. Everybody should know this

Let's go back to the first part of the article, as the skeptical on science and the conspiracy theory became more popular, more people denied climate change, or think that climate change will not be associate with them personally. To confront the conspiracy theories, my suggestion is that we should educate to citizens about climate change more detailly and rationally about the content I wrote in **Part 2**. Excessively exaggerate or simplify the issue may give these conspiracy theory chances. For instance, once in my hometown, my teacher told us a story about preventing student to smoking: When the school uses more horrible propagandas to 'warn' student not to smoking without told them reasons, the smoking rate was high (for these 'rebellious teenagers' they will considered smoking as a brave activity); but the smoking rate decrease when teachers taught students what is the cigarette's effect on human body and the effect of secondhand smoke detailly on health classes, the smoking did decrease. 

In our society, masses' emotion could been manipulated and used by others easily, unless we have true knowledge. Before I did research on this project, I did have many questions about the truth of Climate Changes, but I understood most of them now and could explained it rationally. I'll consider education to be a crucial factor in changing citizen's altitude in climate change, besides simply shouting the slogans about climate change, we have to teach them the scientific explaining of the 'Climate Changes'.

*Pic3 Education*

We lived in a democratic society, only when everyone in the society could understand and support climate change, strong actions could took place. We must understand that we should 'sacrifice' something for our future. These unsubstantiated theory for escaping the fact could be destructive to us. When scientists were been calumniated as mean and evil deceiver, who should be responsible for our future?

---

It's true that climate change is happening now, and its true that climate change is threaten the future of mankind. But, its not the fault of the industrial revolution or anyone else. It's just a battle that all human being around the world should unite together to fight for. I'll feel fully confident that we will win this battle through our own way, the technology and wisdom of us. Even the condition is severe, we should always keep being hopeful.

Go, and Fighting!
